This file is for our second computer science club meeting on 9/15

I have placed some resources in this folder about this robot: https://www.dji.com/robomaster-s1

Research this robot using the resources in this folder or find your own instructions/tutorials/youtube videos
Think about cool things you want to try with it such as ground tricks, 
Place your thoughts and plans (can be as informal as you want) as a text file in this folder so when we focus more on this robot later this month we can start implementing plans in groups and individually.

How to add text file in github:
Click add file -> create new file
